objectives:
-----------

> include analysis using 3 methods:
	1. Naive-Bayes
	2. SVM without kernels
	3. SVM with kernels

> show comparison using plots and numbers


GrossSqFt, GrossIncomeSqFt, MarketValueperSqFt
Classify “Neighborhood”

order of operation:
-------------------

(1) removing outliers (Neighborhood: 0-30)

(2) normalization [scipy.cluster.vp.whiten]

(3) cross-validation (train_test_split)

(4) Naive-Bayes

(5) SVM without kernels

(6) SVM with kernels

(7) write the report
